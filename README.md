# trs80-pascal-compiler

Note the code here comes from a hard copy printout I have of the original and it is throwing out some errors when trying to compile the test.dat file. I do have a floppy disk with the code on but have no means to read the file of the disk - I suspect there are some fixes in the programs on the disk that didn't make it into the printout. At some point I'll try and debug the code here and get it working again.
